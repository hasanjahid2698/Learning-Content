# üß† Caching in ASP.NET Core

## What is Caching?

Caching is the process of storing copies of data in a temporary, fast-access storage location (a cache) so that future requests for that data can be served more quickly.

The primary goal of caching is to **improve application performance and scalability** by reducing the need to perform expensive operations, like database queries or complex calculations, repeatedly.

## 1. In-Memory Caching

### **Concept**

This is the simplest form of caching. The data is stored directly in the memory of the web server.
ASP.NET Core provides a built-in service, `IMemoryCache`, for this.

### **How it Works**

You inject `IMemoryCache` into your services or controllers and use its `Get` or `Set` methods to store and retrieve data.
You can set expiration policies (e.g., absolute time or sliding expiration) for cache entries.

### ‚úÖ **Pros**

* **Extremely Fast:** Reading from memory is one of the fastest operations possible.

### ‚ùå **Cons**

* **Not Distributed:** The cache is tied to a single server instance. In a load-balanced environment (a "web farm"), each server has its own separate cache. This can lead to data inconsistency unless you use "sticky sessions," which is often not ideal.
* **Volatile:** The cache is cleared whenever the application restarts.
* **Consumes Server Memory:** Storing large amounts of data can consume significant server RAM.

## 2. Distributed Caching

### **Concept**

The cache is stored in an external location that is shared by all instances of your web application.
ASP.NET Core provides the `IDistributedCache` interface, with implementations for various external stores.

### **Common Backing Stores**

* **Redis:** An extremely fast, in-memory key-value store. This is the most popular choice for distributed caching.
* **SQL Server:** You can use a SQL Server database table as a distributed cache.
* **NCache:** Another popular distributed caching solution.

### ‚úÖ **Pros**

* **Consistent Across Servers:** All application instances share the same cache, ensuring data consistency.
* **Persistent:** The cache can survive application restarts.
* **Scalable:** The cache service can be scaled independently of your web application.

### ‚ùå **Cons**

* **Slower than In-Memory:** Involves a network call to the external cache service, which adds latency compared to reading from local memory.

## üß© Key Interview Takeaway

| Cache Type            | Interface           | Scope         | Persistence | Speed              | Ideal For                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **In-Memory Cache**   | `IMemoryCache`      | Local Server  | No          | Very Fast          | Single-instance apps               |
| **Distributed Cache** | `IDistributedCache` | Shared/Global | Yes         | Fast (network I/O) | Multi-instance or cloud-based apps |

**Summary:**

* `IMemoryCache` is **very fast** but **local** to a single server and **lost on restart**.
* `IDistributedCache` uses an **external service like Redis**, is **shared across all servers**, and **persistent**, but has **higher latency** due to network calls.
